# Monte-Carlo-Sims

Any kind of practice with Monte Carlo simulations using Numpy.


## Current completed projects
- Geometric Brownian Motion Monte Carlo Simulation 
    - One that has personal inputs
    - One that takes info from Yahoo! Finance and calculates its own expected return and volatility, uses historical average for expected return
    - One that takes the same info as the one above, but then plots 100 iterations of the program on one plot
- Monte Carlo simulation by changing volatility of an option
    - one using uniform distribution of volatility
    - one using normal distribution of volatility, shifted so that volatility is not negative
- pricing options based on a strike of the initial price, then changing price based on GBM
