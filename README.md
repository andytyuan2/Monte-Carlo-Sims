# Monte-Carlo-Sims

Any kind of practice with Monte Carlo simulations using Numpy.


## Current completed projects
- Geometric Brownian Motion Monte Carlo Simulation 
    - Normally distributed 
- Monte Carlo simulation by changing volatility of an option
- pricing options based on a strike of the initial price, then changing price based on GBM
